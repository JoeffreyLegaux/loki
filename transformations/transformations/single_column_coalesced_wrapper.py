class SingleColumnCoalescedTransformation(Transformation):
    """
    Single Column Coalesced: Direct CPU-to-GPU transformation for
    block-indexed gridpoint routines.

    This transformation will remove individiual CPU-style
    vectorization loops from "kernel" routines and either either
    re-insert the vector loop at the highest possible level (without
    interfering with subroutine calls), or completely strip it and
    promote the index variable to the driver if
    ``hoist_column_arrays`` is set.

    Unlike the CLAW-targetting SCA extraction, this will leave the
    block-based array passing structure in place, but pass a
    thread-local array index into any "kernel" routines. The
    block-based argument passing should map well to coalesced memory
    accesses on GPUs.

    Note, this requires preprocessing with the
    :class:`DerivedTypeArgumentsTransformation`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    horizontal : :any:`Dimension`
        :any:`Dimension` object describing the variable conventions used in code
        to define the horizontal data dimension and iteration space.
    vertical : :any:`Dimension`
        :any:`Dimension` object describing the variable conventions used in code
        to define the vertical dimension, as needed to decide array privatization.
    block_dim : :any:`Dimension`
        Optional ``Dimension`` object to define the blocking dimension
        to use for hoisted column arrays if hoisting is enabled.
    directive : string or None
        Directives flavour to use for parallelism annotations; either
        ``'openacc'`` or ``None``.
    hoist_column_arrays : bool
        Flag to trigger the more aggressive "column array hoisting"
        optimization.
    inline_members : bool
        Enable full source-inlining of member subroutines; default: False.
